Runner: a brand new NES game made by Eric Owens.

I made this entire NES game from scratch. This process included every step along the way from creating custom pixel art sprites to creating the logic behind the game. I find it fascinating to work under the limitations of the 6502, the 8-bit microprocessor that the NES uses. It requires much more planning and research in order to implement your logic. This example game isn't that complex, but I still find it fun! You play as a cat that needs to dodge incoming cacti that will approach faster and faster. To play the game, press [Start] to pause/unpause and to restart. Use the [Left] and [Right] on the D-pad to move the character.

To play the game, download the .nes ROM file and open it in an NES emulator of your choice.
